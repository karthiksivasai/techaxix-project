## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Service not found"** - Check your Service ID
2. **"Template not found"** - Check your Template ID
3. **"Public key invalid"** - Check your Public Key
4. **Emails not sending** - Verify email service setup

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure EmailJS service is properly configured
4. Check if your email provider allows API access

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Gmail Setup**: You may need to enable "Less secure app access" or use App Passwords
2. **Rate Limiting**: Free tier has limits, consider upgrading for business use
3. **Spam Protection**: Add CAPTCHA or honeypot fields for production
4. **Email Validation**: The form already validates email format on frontend

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Public keys are safe to expose in frontend code
- Never expose service credentials or private keys
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use
- Monitor for spam submissions

## ðŸ“± Testing

Test your form with:

- Different email formats
- Various subject selections
- Optional phone number
- Long/short messages
- Special characters in text
